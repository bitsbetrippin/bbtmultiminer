# OpenCL Support in excavator

**Please read this document carefully, especially the [Hardware Acceleration](#hardwareacceleration) section, if you are mining Ethash- or Equihash-based coins.** 

This version of excavator has initial support for OpenCL devices,
including the AMD Radeon series graphics cards. This is still work in
progress and mostly optimized for RX 470/480/570/580 for now. 
If you have any questions/concerns/feedback, please feel free
to post them to:

* [excavator by NiceHash](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1777827) (bitcointalk.org)

Alternatively, you can directly email the author at:

* [zawawawawawawawawa@gmail.com](mailto:zawawawawawawawawa@gmail.com)

It is my hope that excavator would be useful for everybody with
top-notch performance, solid reliability, and exceptional flexibility,
and I am grateful to NiceHash for giving me an opportunity to work on this miner.
Enjoy!

## Prerequisites

Excavator *should* work with any OpenCL-compatible devices. For optimal performance,
however, please use AMD graphics cards with 
the GCN2 architecture or above.


## <a name="hardwareacceleration"></a> Hardware Acceleration

Excavator supports hardware acceleration for daggerhashimoto/Ethash- and Equihash-based 
coins, such as Ethereum and Zcash. In order to enable it, you need to **run 
the miner as administrator** as excavator needs to access the graphics 
card directly. Furthermore,  for the initial run,
it is highly recommended to **reset the graphics card to the stock settings, including the BIOS.**

If everything goes well, you should see the following message:

    Loaded phymem for direct PCIe access.
    
Otherwise:

    Failed to load phymem.
    Please run miner as administrator if you are using AMD cards.

Also, it should be noted that excavator's hardware acceleration is not compatible
with MSI Afterburner and Radeon Settings. They will be automatically shut down 
when excavator starts and resumed when it quits.


## Supported Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently supported:

Name | Supported devices | Wcount*1 | Pcount*2
-----------------|----------|---------|----
[daggerhashimoto](#daggerhashimoto) | GCN2+ | 1 | 2
[equihash](#equihash) | GCN2+ | 2 | 2
[pascal](#pascal) | GCN1+ | 4 | 3
[sia](#sia) | GCN1+ | 4 | 2
[decred](#decred) | GCN1+ | 4 | 4

If no parameters are provided, device specific defaults are used. If provided parameter is '0' then device specific default value is used.

*1 Recommended number of workers per device to reach optimal speeds.

*2 Number of supported parameters. Parameters are explained in details in section for each algorithm.
